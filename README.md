The project aims to automate the process of creating personalized diet plans by leveraging genetic algorithms. By inputting user-specific information such as age, weight, height, and activity level, the algorithm generates an optimized diet plan tailored to the individual's nutritional requirements and budget constraints. This approach offers a systematic and efficient way to address the complex task of meal planning, making it accessible to a wider audience. Moreover, by considering ingredient availability and cost, the algorithm ensures practicality and affordability in implementing the recommended diet plan.
